Client-side Rule Checking

  Motivation:
  server-side
    - takes up our resources :(
    - slow for checking (time grows exponentially with number of courses in plan)
    - slow for back/forth response (have to make/receive http requests to/from server)
    - result might not make it through
    - increased wait time for users (back/forth time + checking time)
  client-side
    - rule checking done by user's machine, saves resources on our end :)
    - fast checking (time grows linearly with number of courses in plan)
    - don't have to make additional http requests
    - will always have result
    - rules update instantly (so to speak)

 How it works:
  naive implementation
    - rule object
      {
        name: "IMARULE", 
        num_courses: 2, 
        num_units: 8
      }
    - keep track of how many courses are tagged with "IMARULE" (totalCourses)
    - add their units together (totalUnits)
    - rule passes if totalCourses >= num_courses and totalUnits >= num_units
    drawbacks:
      - can't handle rules that don't have a set number of courses or units
        ex. the overall major can be satisfied with a variable number of courses/units
        just because you have a large number of units or courses, doesn't mean you've satisfied
        the major

    solution
      - rule object
        {
          name: "IMACOOLERRULE", 
          num_courses: 0, 
          num_units:0, 
          bool_op: "AND", 
          subrules:
          [
            {
              name: "IMARULE",
              num_courses: 2
              num_units: 8
              bool_op: "none"
              subrules: []
            }
          ]
        }
      - break down rules so that each piece works with the naive solution (i.e. you can tell if you passed it
      by checking num_courses or num_units)
      - a rule passes if totalCourses >= num_courses, totalUnits >= num_units, AND X
        X can be
          - all subrules pass (bool_op: "AND")
          - one of the subrules passes (bool_op: "OR")
      - for updating old rules:
        - if the main rule is a same_course, course_regex, course, OR, etc. where it can be satisfied by a single course, 
        then it should be fine as is (it's the equivalent of having num_courses = 1)
        - if it is an AND, then it will most likely need to be rewritten as a count_courses or units
          - if the rule can be satisfied by a variable number of units/courses (see phys_math in moltox in the original 
          test-rules.yaml), then break it down into the largest blocks you can that are count_courses/units subrules (see below)

      example:
        ORIGINAL

        phys_math:
          description: "Physical Sciences and Math (26-28 units)"
          rule: AND
          args:
            - OR:
                - AND:
                    - course: MATH.16A
                    - course: MATH.16B
                    - course: STAT.2
                - AND:
                    - course: MATH.1A
                    - course: STAT.2
                - AND:
                    - course: MATH.10A
                    - course: MATH.10B
            - course: CHEM.1A
            - course: CHEM.1AL
            - course: CHEM.3A
            - course: CHEM.3AL
            - course: CHEM.3B
            - course: CHEM.3BL
            - course: PHYSICS.8A

        break down into largest possible pieces that work with naive solution (can be passed by checking num_courses/units)
        sometimes you will have to break down even those pieces

        phys_math:
          description: "Physical Sciences and Math (26-28 units)"
          rule: AND
          args:
            - OR:
              - rule: math1
              - rule: math2
              - rule: math3
            - course: CHEM.1A
            - course: CHEM.1AL
            - course: CHEM.3A
            - course: CHEM.3AL
            - course: CHEM.3B
            - course: CHEM.3BL
            - course: PHYSICS.8A

        ideally, you would break it down further

        phys_math:
          description: "Physical Sciences and Math (26-28 units)"
          rule: AND
          args:
            - rule: math
            - course: CHEM.1A
            - course: CHEM.1AL
            - course: CHEM.3A
            - course: CHEM.3AL
            - course: CHEM.3B
            - course: CHEM.3BL
            - course: PHYSICS.8A

        and further

        phys_math:
          description: "Physical Sciences and Math (26-28 units)"
          rule: AND
          args:
            - rule: math
            - rule: physical

        since that means the front-end would only have to check two tags (broken down 3 times) as opposed to
        8 (broken down twice), or 10 (broken down once)
