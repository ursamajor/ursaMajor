functionality

- ability to add more semesters
- ability to clear board/semester
- selecting which rules you want
- UI for editing rules/yaml
- all query matching across period (allow spaces in queries)
- handling more than one major

appearance

- in results, adding a checkmark shifts everything a bit
- course info
- display unit total
- landing page
- make ui more responsive

chores

- going through completed rules, make sure they work
- shorten names of rules
- mapping of names/rename departments
- sort courses by name and number (after doing so, remove initial sort in js)
  - more efficient -> place garbage course in right place instead of sorting everything
- separate courses and plans controller again (combined for sake of duplicate removal)

brainstorm

- checking multipart rules(ones that can't be satisfied just seeing numcourses/numunits, ex. a major)
  - rule passes if meets num_courses, num_units + all sub_rules pass

- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
  - all different combinations to decide which one to remove/use for a certain rule
  - flag as an exclusive rule, which removes course from plan when checking rest
