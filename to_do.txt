In Progress
- fix button for inplace editing of name
- remove course if used for rule and can only be used once
  - all different combinations to decide which one to remove/use for a certain rule
    - utility function of numRulesSatisfied, proportion of courses left to fulfill other requirements
  - flag as an exclusive rule, which removes course from plan when checking rest
  
Next Tasks
- switch things to minified js
- tag line
- better mappings of department names, also search by title/description
- consistent displaying of rules (only main, no hidden)
- show units in course page
- show unit count of fulfilling set
- selecting which rules you want
- switch plans without reload
- editing of course info in ui
- display rule description in modal, plus courses that satisfy
- display course names as search_name ones all throughout site
- sort courses beforehand in rails
  - more efficient -> place garbage course in right place instead of sorting everything

  - fail fast
  - check subrules at same time as main rule
